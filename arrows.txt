Fear will not pierce our hearts, the searching arrows wound
Victory is our reward for all the blood we spilled
We didn’t come to waste our lives, like pawns in a savage game
Our spirits, shields and spears are linked in a much stronger chain
=======
Hold the lines, move as one
In unity our victory’s won
Our shields will form a mighty wall
United we shall never fall
