sword and spear
wall of shields
standing strong
on their chosen battlefield

Form the lines
Shield by shield
Side by side
We’re marching into destiny

March as one, don’t look back
Oden’s sons: attack!

Unleash hell, do not repent
Warfare grants us no lament
Let your weapons slash and tear
This is no place for fear
